## Overview

### Description

Neurolinguistics is a seminar on language and the brain. For the first few weeks, you will build a foundation of knowledge, first on how brains work (neurons, networks, and anatomy) and later on the methods researchers use to study language in the brain. The remainder of the course will explore the literature on different topics in language and the brain, including various levels of linguistics (phonology, morphology, syntax), acquisition, evolution, signed languages, and more.

*This course is open to all graduate students and upper-level undergraduates. No specific background in neuroscience or linguistics is necessary to participate in the course*

### Requirements

- **Reading and posting discussion questions**: Each week, you will be responsible for preparing for the discussion by reading and annotating 2-3 papers on the weeks’ topic with discussion questions (on Perusall). [See the annotation guidelines](https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/p7oojNVWQXJRH6BVe5bteXFX)
- **Lead discussions**: Several times throughout the semester (but not every week), you will serve as discussion leader for a paper with one or two other students. As discussion leader, you’ll be responsible for presenting the paper, including summarizing (motivation, research questions, approach, and findings) and leading a discussion of the work. If you cannot attend synchronously you can submit a pre-recorded presentation. 
- **Lit Review**: You will select a topic of interest (within the bounds of language and the brain) and write a formal literature review. There will be several assignments leading up to this final paper to help you make progress.

### Typical week

- **Fridays** are deadline days. Writing assignment and feedback deadlines are always Friday at midnight (but note not all Fridays have something due)
- **Wednesdays** are discussion days. Small groups of students will present papers and lead the discussion during class time. 

## Getting Help

- **Ed Disucssion:** The best way to get help anytime is to ask a question on the [discussion board](https://edstem.org/us/courses/13251/discussion/). You'll get a response within 24 hours, usually much faster. Students are encouraged to answer each other's questions as well. 
- **On papers:** You can ask questions about papers and discuss them via Perusall.

 
### Materials

- **[Course website](index.md)** (you are here) for schedule, policies, and links to all assigned materials
- **[Canvas site](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1613834)** for assignment submissions and grade related things
- **[Perusall](https://app.perusall.com/courses/neurolinguistics/_/dashboard/assignments)** for reading assignments (access code on canvas). 
- **[Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/us/courses/13251/discussion/)** for online discussion and support

### Evaluation 
- **Class participation and preparation (50%)**  including reading and annotating to start the discussion on Perusall, participating in class discussions, and preparing for and leading discussions when you are a discussion leader. [Grading rubric here](https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/uATqsDvYdptdvtFXC2jYFnQ6). 
- **Literature review (50%)**  including several check-points throughout the semester (abstract, bibliography, drafts, peer review) and your final literature review.


## Schedule
Schedule is subject to change. All sessions will be recorded and [posted here]() a few minutes after each class.

## Policies

- **Attendance**: There is no formal attendance policy, but participation is highly correlated with class performance (see Evaluation section). 
- **Accommodations**: I'm happy to provide accommodations to anyone with documentation from Student Disability Services and to make alternate arrangements when class conflicts with a religious holiday. Please notify your lab section TA as soon as possible to make these arrangements.
- **Academic Integrity**: We will follow the rules of the University and the [Code of Academic Integrity](https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/code-of-academic-integrity/).  It is your responsibility to be familiar with these policies.
