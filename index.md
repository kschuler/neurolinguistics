## Overview

### Description

Neurolinguistics is a seminar on language and the brain. For the first few weeks, you will build a foundation of knowledge, first on how brains work (neurons, networks, and anatomy) and later on the methods researchers use to study language in the brain. The remainder of the course will explore the literature on different topics in language and the brain, including various levels of linguistics (phonology, morphology, syntax), acquisition, evolution, signed languages, and more.

*This course is open to all graduate students and upper-level undergraduates. No specific background in neuroscience or linguistics is necessary to participate in the course*

### Requirements

- **Reading and posting discussion questions**: Each week, you will be responsible for preparing for the discussion by reading and annotating 2-3 papers on the weeks’ topic with discussion questions (on Perusall).
- **Lead discussions**: Several times throughout the semester (but not every week), you will serve as discussion leader for a paper with one or two other students. As discussion leader, you’ll be responsible for presenting the paper, including summarizing (motivation, research questions, approach, and findings) and leading a discussion of the work. If you cannot attend synchronously you can submit a pre-recorded presentation. 
- **Lit Review**: You will select a topic of interest (within the bounds of language and the brain) and write a formal literature review. There will be several assignments leading up to this final paper to help you make progress.

## Getting Help

- **Ed Disucssion:** The best way to get help anytime is to ask a question on the [discussion board](https://edstem.org/us/courses/13251/discussion/). You'll get a response within 24 hours, usually much faster. Students are encouraged to answer each other's questions as well. 
- **On papers:** You can ask questions about papers and discuss them via Perusall.

 
### Materials

- **[Course website](index.md)** (you are here) for schedule, policies, and links to all assigned materials
- **[Canvas site](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1613834)** for assignment submissions and grade related things
- **[Perusall](https://app.perusall.com/courses/neurolinguistics/_/dashboard/assignments)** for reading assignments (access code on canvas). 
- **[Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/us/courses/13251/discussion/)** for online discussion and support

### Evaluation 
- **Class participation and preparation (50%)**  including reading and annotating to start the discussion on Perusall, participating in class discussions, and preparing for and leading discussions when you are a discussion leader. Grading rubric here. 
- **Literature review (50%)**  including 9 check-points throughout the semester (abstract, bibliography, drafts, peer review) and your final literature review.


## Schedule
Schedule is subject to change. All sessions will be recorded and [posted here]() a few minutes after each class.

- **Accommodations**: We are happy to provide accommodations to anyone with documentation from Student Disability Services and to make alternate arrangements when class conflicts with a religious holiday. Please notify your lab section TA as soon as possible to make these arrangements.
- **Academic Integrity**: We will follow the rules of the University and the [Code of Academic Integrity](https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/code-of-academic-integrity/).  It is your responsibility to be familiar with these policies.

## FAQs

**I am not comfortable coming to the 80 person lecture in person due to COVID. Can I watch the lectures online instead?**
> Yes, of course! We know many students won't feel comfortable in an enclosed space with this many people just yet. All lectures will be recorded and posted [here]() a few minutes after class. You can watch on your own, or form a small group of peers to watch together if you are more comfortable. 

**Can I skip the fourth exam if I am happy with my grade on the first three?**
> Yes! You can skip the fourth exam and it will be dropped. Your grade will be based on the first three exams.

**If I miss lab can I come to another recitation section that week?**
> Sure! You can join any lab session that will work for your schedule. But keep in mind that the rooms are small so it’s best to email the section TA to let them know.

**I am not comfortable attending lab in person. What should I do?**
> We expect labs to have around 15-20 people each week, so they will be much smaller than lecture. If you still don't feel comfortable, we recommend trying the problem sets on your own, and then attending virtual office hours to get help. You can also ask questions on Ed 

as you are working through them. 

**I noticed a mistake in the grading of my exam. How do I get this fixed?**
> We will look at your exam again if you make a formal [re-grade request](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1489351/modules/items/17298855) via Canvas within one week of getting your exam back.

**I missed or failed an exam. What can I do to make it up?**
> Nothing. We don't allow make-up exams or retakes. However, we drop your lowest exam score, so you can still do well in the class. Just make sure it doesn't happen more than once! 

**Can I turn in my data journal late?** 
> Yep! Data journals will be accepted without penalty through the last day of class (Dec 10th).

**I missed class, how can I catch up?**
> All of the lectures will be automatically recorded and posted to canvas a few minutes after class ends. You can watch the lectures when you are ready. We also recommend attending office hours and lab sections to make sure you don't fall behind. 

**I do not feel well, tested positive for COVID, and/or need to quarantine. What should I do?**
> Please don't come to class if you are unwell or under quarantine. Follow the steps in the question above (under "I missed class") to catch up. If you miss a lab, you can try the problem sets on your own and schedule a virtual office hours to catch up. If you will miss an exam for this reason, let us know and we will work with you.

**What will happen if one of the instructors or TAs does not feel well, tests positive, and/or needs to quarantine?**
> We will teach the course remotely if we need to, or fill in for each other if we can. We have a large teaching team, so this shouldn't be an issue.
